# `scripts/show_agent_status.py`

## Purpose

Consolidated Agent Identity status and health check. Combines local state
(`.entrabot-state.json`, `.env`-derived configuration) with live Microsoft
Graph queries to report on the Blueprint, Agent Identity, Agent User,
sponsors, permission grants, Blueprint certificates, licenses, and storage
configuration in one command — the canonical way to answer "is my Agent
Identity chain healthy?"

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ with `entrabot` and `azure-identity` installed
  (`pip install -e ".[provisioning]"`).
- The Provisioner app must already be bootstrapped: `.entrabot-state.json`
  at the repo root needs `PROVISIONER_CLIENT_ID` and `TENANT_ID`, and the
  Provisioner's certificate private key must be present in the OS keystore
  (Keychain / Windows Certificate Store / Secret Service via `keyring`).
  This command mints its Graph token from the **Provisioner's certificate
  credential** (`CertificateCredential` + `client_credentials`) — it does
  **not** use the Agent User three-hop flow. If the Provisioner isn't
  bootstrapped, run `python3 scripts/entra_provisioning.py` (or full
  `setup.sh`) first.
- Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/show_agent_status.py
python scripts/show_agent_status.py --json
python scripts/show_agent_status.py --health-only
python scripts/show_agent_status.py --health-only --strict
python scripts/show_agent_status.py --help
```

## Options

- `--json` — print the full snapshot (state, platform info, storage
  config, sponsors, licenses, permission grants, key credentials, and
  health checks) as a single JSON object instead of the formatted text
  report.
- `--health-only` — print only the pass/fail/warn/skip health checks,
  skipping the detailed sections. Always returns a non-zero exit code if
  any check fails, regardless of `--strict`.
- `--strict` — return exit code `1` when any health check has failed;
  has no visible effect on output, only on the exit code. Implied by
  `--health-only`.

No positional arguments.

## Effects

- Reads `.entrabot-state.json` keys: `TENANT_ID`, `PROVISIONER_CLIENT_ID`,
  `PROVISIONER_CERT_THUMBPRINT`, `BLUEPRINT_APP_ID`, `BLUEPRINT_OBJECT_ID`,
  `BLUEPRINT_CERT_THUMBPRINT`, `AGENT_ID`, `AGENT_OBJECT_ID`,
  `AGENT_USER_ID`, `AGENT_USER_UPN`, and `AGENT_USER_WORK_IQ_LICENSE_SKU`.
- Reads storage configuration from the process environment / `.env` via
  `entrabot.config.get_config()`.
- Issues read-only Graph GET requests (no writes to Graph or local state):
  - `/servicePrincipals/{agentOid}/microsoft.graph.agentIdentity/sponsors` (beta)
  - `/subscribedSkus` and `/users/{agentUserId}` (assigned licenses, v1.0)
  - `/oauth2PermissionGrants?$filter=clientId eq '...' and principalId eq '...'` (v1.0)
  - `/servicePrincipals/{resourceId}` per distinct grant resource, to resolve display names
  - `/applications/{blueprintObjectId}` for Blueprint `keyCredentials` (v1.0)
- Recomputes the SHA-256 JWT thumbprint of every Blueprint key credential
  locally and compares it against `BLUEPRINT_CERT_THUMBPRINT` to detect
  certificate drift between Entra and local state.
- All output goes to stdout — the formatted text report, the health-only
  list, or the `--json` payload. The single error path (Provisioner token
  acquisition failure) also prints to stdout (`ERROR: Cannot acquire
  token: ...`), not stderr.

## Exit behavior

- Returns `1` if the Provisioner Graph token cannot be acquired
  (`ProvisionerBootstrapError`).
- Otherwise returns `1` when `(--strict or --health-only)` is true **and**
  at least one health check has `status == "fail"`.
- Returns `0` in every other case — including runs where checks report
  `warn` or `skip` but no `fail`, and non-strict, non-health-only runs
  regardless of check outcomes.
- `--help` exits `0` (argparse default).

## Common failures

- **`ERROR: Cannot acquire token: ...`** — the Provisioner app isn't
  bootstrapped, or its certificate is missing from the local OS keystore.
  Run `python3 scripts/entra_provisioning.py` or `setup.sh`.
- **"State completeness" check fails** — one or more required keys is
  missing from `.entrabot-state.json`; re-run `setup.sh`.
- **"Certificate" check warns "not found in Entra"** — the local
  `BLUEPRINT_CERT_THUMBPRINT` doesn't match any key credential currently
  on the Blueprint app, typically after an out-of-band cert rotation; see
  [`verify_blueprint_cert.py`](../auth-and-certs/verify-blueprint-cert-py.md).
- **"Sponsors" / "Licenses" / "Permissions" checks fail** — use
  [`add_agent_sponsor.py`](../provisioning/add-agent-sponsor-py.md),
  [`assign_agent_user_licenses.py`](../provisioning/assign-agent-user-licenses-py.md),
  or [`grant_consent.py`](../auth-and-certs/grant-consent-py.md) respectively.
