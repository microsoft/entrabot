"""Per-chat Teams poll cursor — persisted through ``MemoryBackend``.

Solves GitHub issue #17: the background Teams poll's per-chat cursor
(``last_ts``, ``seen_ids``, ``bootstrapped``) used to live in-process at
``_state["watched_chats"][chat_id]`` only. On every MCP restart the bootstrap
path re-surfaced "the newest message at boot" as if it were fresh — even when
that newest message was days old — and messages that arrived during a server-
down window were silently dropped.

This module persists the cursor through the same ``MemoryBackend`` protocol
used by ``interaction_log.py`` / ``daily_summary.py`` (ADR-005 Phase 2). One
key per chat (``chat_cursors/<chat_id>.json``) so writes to a busy chat don't
rewrite a giant blob.

Same shape as :mod:`entrabot.tools.email_poll` — parallel architecture, same
problem class, already-solved-once.

Cursor schema (per chat):

    {
        "last_ts":         "2026-06-09T18:59:15.261Z",
        "seen_ids_tail":   ["msg-id-1", "msg-id-2", ...],   # ~50 most recent
        "bootstrapped":    true,
        "last_written_at": "2026-06-09T19:00:43.000Z"
    }

Storage destination: ``LocalBackend`` by default; ``BlobBackend`` when blob
env vars are set. NEVER persona-sati — this is operational state, same bucket
as ``watched_chats`` and ``email_cursor.txt``.
